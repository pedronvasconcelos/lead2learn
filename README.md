# Spring Modulith Project: Kotlin and Java Interoperability

## English Version

This project demonstrates the use of Spring Modulith with a mix of Kotlin and Java modules, showcasing the interoperability between these two languages on the JVM platform.

### Project Objective

The main goal of this project is to apply and demonstrate the interoperability between Kotlin and Java within a modular Spring application. By using both languages in different modules, we aim to leverage the strengths of each language while maintaining a cohesive and well-structured application.

### Project Structure

The project is organized into multiple modules, some written in Kotlin and others in Java. This structure allows us to showcase how these languages can work together seamlessly in a Spring Modulith context.

### Project Rules

1. **Language Interoperability**: Modules can be written in either Kotlin or Java.
2. **Testing Rule**: If a class is written in Java, its corresponding test must be written in Kotlin, and vice versa. This rule enforces cross-language understanding and promotes full interoperability.

### Modules

(Describe your modules here, e.g.:)
- `common`: Common classes (Kotlin)
- `crm`: Customer relationship management (Java)
